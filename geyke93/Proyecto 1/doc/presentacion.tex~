Cryptp++
ciphers (XSalsa20), message authentication codes, one-way hash functions, public-key cryptosystems, and key agreement schemes.

Beecrypt
BeeCrypt is an ongoing project to provide a strong and fast cryptography toolkit. Includes entropy sources, random generators, block ciphers, hash functions, message authentication codes, multiprecision integer routines, and public key primitives.

BeeCrypt is a cryptography library that contains highly optimized C and assembler implementations of many well-known algorithms including Blowfish, MD5, SHA-1, Diffie-Hellman, and ElGamal. Unlike some other crypto libraries, BeeCrypt is not designed to solve one specific problem, like file encryption, but to be a general purpose toolkit which can be used in a variety of applications. There are also no patent or royalty issues associated with BeeCrypt.

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.

The structures in the library are geared towards exchange with Java and its security and cryptography classes. This library can also be accessed from Java by installing BeeCrypt for Java, a JCE 1.2 crypto provider and the counterpart of this library.

hashlib++
is a simple and very easy to use library to create a cryptographic checksum called "hash" in C++. hashlib++ is written in plain C++ and should work with every compiler and platform. The library is released under the BSD-license and therefore free software. Copyright (c) 2007-2011 Benjamin Gr√ºdelbach

hashlib++ allows you to create a hash (for example MD5 or SHA1) with only one single method-call. So if you want to create a hash based on a file or a string quickly you might be interested.

PPT is ready and comes with a new simple factory class to create wrappers dynamically.
